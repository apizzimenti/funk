## da_funk

This package is a collection of useful array functions not provided in the current version of javascript.

### installation

`$ bower install da_funk [--save[-dev]]`

`$ git clone https://github.com/apizzimenti/funk.git`

### features

* All methods operate on the array in-place, so reassigning variables and taking up extra memory isn't necessary
* Both the `f` object and its methods are static, so there is no need to call `new f()` - simply start using it (i.e.
`f.removeValue(1)`)
* [Comprehensive documentation is available](http://apizzimenti.github.io/funk-docs/)
