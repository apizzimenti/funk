## Installation

This package is accessible from bower as well as this repository. There are two installation methods:

`$ bower install da_funk [--save[-dev]]`

or 

`$ git clone https://github.com/apizzimenti/funk.git`

## Usage

All of `f`'s methods are static. This means that there is no need for a new instance of `f` (unless you really want to).

```
// ex.js

var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
f.removeValue(a, 2);
```
